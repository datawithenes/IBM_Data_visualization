# IBM_Data_visualization
# Data Visualization Lab

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates techniques for visualizing data retrieved from a SQLite database. It is part of a series of labs focused on exploring and presenting data effectively.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**:
  - Downloads data from a remote server.
  - Connects to a SQLite database for querying and data extraction.
- **Visualization Techniques**:
  - Implements Python libraries for creating insightful visualizations.
  - Explores data trends through visual storytelling.

## Requirements

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- `sqlite3` (part of the Python standard library)
- Additional visualization libraries as required (e.g., `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).

Install missing libraries using:
```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or a compatible environment.
2. Run the code cells sequentially:
   - Download and connect to the SQLite database.
   - Execute SQL queries and visualize the extracted data.
3. Modify the SQL queries or visualization parameters to explore custom insights.

## Outputs

- Interactive and static visualizations showcasing key data patterns.
- Insights into the dataset retrieved from the SQLite database.
